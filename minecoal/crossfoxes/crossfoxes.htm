                <h3>Historic Demonstration</h3>
                <p>At one meeting in the late 19th century, <strong>over 6,000 people</strong> gathered here for a demonstration. They were addressed by <span class="highlight">William Twiss</span>, a union leader from Lancashire.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">This gathering demonstrates the strength and unity of the mining workforce in North Wales during the height of the coal industry.</p>

            <h2>Mining Unions in North Wales</h2>
            <p>The mining unions played a vital role in improving conditions for workers across the coalfields. Meeting places like the Cross Foxes Inn were essential for organizing collective action and building solidarity among miners.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Union leaders from other coalfields, like William Twiss from Lancashire, would travel to address local meetings, sharing experiences and strategies from their own struggles for better working conditions.</p>
