            <h2>Why Have a Trust?</h2>
            <p>Coal has been mined in North Wales for many centuries and left its mark on the surface and within communities. The last colliery at Point of Ayr closed in 1996, but today there are very few reminders of an industry that provided work for thousands of men.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Even the old coal tips are disappearing, either landscaped or removed for their content. The only major remains left now are at Bersham where the headgear and winding engine house still stand next to the tip. The winding engine itself is still there inside, all thanks to ex-miner <span class="highlight">Ted McKay</span>, who negotiated with British Coal when the mine closed in 1986.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>The Trust intends to preserve what remains are still left and to interpret them to the public.</strong></p>
