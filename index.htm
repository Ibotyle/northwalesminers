            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>Coal and lead have been mined in North Wales for many centuries, leaving their mark on the landscape and within communities. The last colliery at Point of Ayr closed in 1996, but today very few reminders of an industry that provided work for thousands of men remain.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">The Trust works to preserve what remains and interpret them to the public, ensuring future generations understand this important heritage.</p>

                    <h3>School Visits</h3>
                    <p>One of our aims is to visit local schools where we can give presentations about working life and conditions in the coal mines. Our ex-miners can adapt their talk to your requirements and the age of pupils.</p>

                    <p>The only major mining remains left in North Wales are at Bersham, where the headgear and winding engine house still stand. The winding engine itself is still there inside, preserved thanks to ex-miner Ted McKay who negotiated with British Coal when the mine closed in 1986.</p>

            <h2>Gresford Disaster</h2>
            <p>The Gresford mining disaster occurred on 22 September 1934 at Gresford Colliery, near Wrexham. 266 men lost their lives, making it one of Britain's worst mining disasters.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">We hold documents including working plans of the disaster area, contemporary reports, first-hand commentary from rescue brigades, and lists of the deceased.</p>
